Hello Guys,

This is a simple ToDoTask application created using Salesforce Lightning Web Components Framework.

In this ToDoTask app , I have used below LWC tags.

Lightning Tags :
1) Lightning-card
2) lightning-layout
3) lightning-layout-item
4) lightning-button-icon
5) lightning-button
6) template-forEach


This is a simple app where you can add task by insertig Task name and adding the taks by clicking the Add button.

You can also delete the task by clicking delete button icon.
for deleting records i have used javascript filter method.
